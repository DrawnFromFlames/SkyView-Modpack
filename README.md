# SkyView-Modpack

Currently just a pack to play with friends with Valkreyn Skies being the core mod of the pack

Sky view is a pack I made to take your base everywhere you go! Take to the skies and everything with you and explore without having to walk thousands of blocks back to your base

KEEP IN MIND THIS IS IN BETA and is not at all complete

Things that still need chaining:

- Some quests are impossible to complete
- Early game improvements
- 30% of the time creating worlds will softlock the game
- Server pack
- relay wire quests ask for more than necessary
- add a rope ladder quest to introduce players to it, maybe even some more openblock mods stuff
- make a discord server for support and bug reporting
- Dragon's temporarily disabled dew to crashes
- Item Placeholders still exsist
- Design Betterquesting interface
